# PE File Analyzer

A command-line tool for analyzing Portable Executable (PE) files. This program extracts various attributes of PE files, including file type, number of imported DLLs, compilation time, entry point validation, and more.

## Features

- **Identify File Type**: Determines if the PE file is a DLL, EXE, or SYS.
- **Count DLL Imports**: Counts the total number of imported DLLs.
- **Count Total Imports**: Counts the total number of functions imported from DLLs.
- **Compilation Time**: Outputs the compilation date and time of the PE file.
- **Entry Point Validation**: Alerts if the entry point is not in a valid section (e.g., .text, .code, CODE, INIT).
- **Packer Identification**: Identifies packers used in the PE file.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Calculates and evaluates the entropy of each section to determine if it may be packed or compressed.
- **Checksum Verification**: Verifies if the optional header checksum matches the calculated checksum.
- **Resource Dumping**: Extracts the first resource from the PE file and saves it to a text file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pefile` library
- `peutils` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pefile peutils
